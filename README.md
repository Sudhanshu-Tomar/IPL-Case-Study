Welcome to the IPL SQL Case Study! In this case study, we will be conducting an analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) data for the years 2008, 2009, and 2017. 
The dataset consists of two tables: "deliveries" and "matches."

The "deliveries" table contains information about individual deliveries in each match, including details such as match ID, inning, batting team, bowling team, 
over, ball, batsman, non-striker, bowler, runs scored, extras, dismissal details, and more.

The "matches" table provides information about each match, including the match ID, season, city, date, teams involved, toss details, result, winning team, 
player of the match, venue, and umpires.
